Patterns or Surprises: All fuctions used math properties and symbols like * or %. I noticed I had to be careful with the return values. 

Logic that challenged me: Making sure that isOdd and isEven functions worked with negative numbers too. 

How might this toolkit be used in real world?: This toolkit could be like a foundation or base for a future UTILITY library for applications that need math helpers or it could help other coders with simple shortcuts for math.
