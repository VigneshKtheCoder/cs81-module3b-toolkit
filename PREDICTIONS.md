My Prediction for double function: I predict that the function will double the given number (n). For example double (4) will give 8. 

My prediction for the square function: I predict that the function will square the given number (a). For example a=9, then the output will be 81 

My prediction for the isEven function: I predict that the function will give the output of "true" since the given number will be tested to see if it is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is even. For example, 4 is divisible by 2, so it is even. 

My prediction for the isOdd function: I predict that the function will give the output of "true" since the given number will be tested to see if it is NOT divisible by 2. If it is NOT, then it is odd. For example, 9 is NOT divisible by 2, so it is odd. 

My prediction for the multiply function: I predict that the function will multiple a and b together, in this example it is 5 and 6, to get the final output of 30.

My prediction for the cube function: I predict that the function will cube the given value for c (5). For example, 5^3 will be 125.
